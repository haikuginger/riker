Command software to mosh up lirc receiving with TCP, Bluetooth, and IR control

Logitech Harmony remotes are great... from a software perspective. From a hardware perspective, they suck. Especially batteries. Riker is designed to let you use whatever remote you want to control whatever you want - whether that's by sending commands over TCP, Bluetooth, or feeding them back over IR.
